      <h3>Ruby is the language for you!</h3>
      <img src="img/ruby.png">
      <p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

      Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, and Lisp</p>

      <h3>JavaScript is the language for you!</h3>
      <img src="img/java.png">
      <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

      Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.</p>

      <h3>C Sharp is the language for you!</h3>
      <img src="img/csharp.jpg">
      <p>C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.

      C# was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen, being one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). The most recent version is 9.0, which was released in 2020 in .NET 5.0 and included in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8.</p>

    <div id="whiteSpace">
      <h3>Are you sure you are from this planet? <br>Maybe Whitespace is the language for you...</h3>
      <img src="img/whitespace.jpeg">
      <p>Whitespace was created by Edwin Brady and Chris Morris as an April Fools’ joke. Where most programming languages ignore whitespace characters, Whitespace uses them as commands, ignoring non-whitespace characters instead. Because of this, Whitespace code can be written inside programming languages that ignore whitespace. To the left is a ‘Hello World!’ source code written in Whitespace (color is used for clarity). <br><em>PS: Your location has been tracked. The intergalactic police will come for you shortly. I hope your Universal Visa is up to date and valid.</em></p>
